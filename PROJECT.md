## <a name="rparts"></a>Replacement parts
### <a name="mirror"></a>Laser mirror (reflective round thing)
The TkkrLab laser cutter will take mirrors with a diameter of 25mm and a thickness of 3mm.
Base materials can either be Si Mo or Cu, the differences are described below. Currently installed are Si type mirrors.
The current mirror set that is installed into the laser cutter is Si, however more recommended with novice use would Mo since they are more scratch and heat resistant.

K9
Gold coated K9(BK7) crystal glass (borosilicate crown glass). They are far from ideal. when using them with a laser beam. They are of poor quality and can only be used with laser system of 35 watts and below. At least they are cheap
Refractive index: n = 17.768

Si
Gold coated silicon glass, these mirror have a good reflective index. These mirror should be replaced about once a year and are usable for up to 60 watts laser systems.
Refractive index: n = 17.768

Mo
Mirror made out of molybdenum, it does not have the best reflective index, but they are tough and rather scratch resistant. Also they are ideal for high power laser cutters 80 watts and up.
Refractive index: n = 13.478

Cu
gold coated copper mirror, these mirror have a good reflective index but stronger than Si. They don't have to be replaced often. Ideal for higher power laser cutters 50 watts and up
Refractive index: n = 17.768


### <a name="lens"></a>Laser lens (the thing that focuses the beam, this is not reflective)
The TkkrLab laser cutter will take a lens with a diameter of 12mm and a thickness between 2 and 3mm. The material has to be ZnSe since normal glass and other materials will not allow infrared to pass trough.
We currently have a focal length (fl) of 38.1mm however recommended is 50.8mm

The most common focal lengths are 38.1mm 50.8mm 63.5mm 76.2mm and 101.6mm 
The longer the focal length is the narrower the beam is, meaning that you can cut trough thicker material.
The shorter focal length has the benefit to be much better with engraving and cutting trough thin materials, while the longer focal length is better for cutting thick materials.
For a more all round machine the 50.8mm is recommended.
